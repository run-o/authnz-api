# FastAPI template project with RLS Access Control

Development of a basic FastAPI sample project with DB level access control using Postgres RLS.
This project serves 2 purposes:
- boilerplate FastAPI project for my own development needs with basic authentication mechanisms
- proof-of-concept authorization layer at the DB level using Postgres RLS for application users
